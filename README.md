# Face-Recognition-In-Video
	A Face-Recognition-In-Video project that consist in applying face recognition inside video
	to detect target faces.
This project should be used as proposal for the capstone project of the Udacity's MLND.

Proposal

(approx. 2-3 pages)
Domain Background

(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)

In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.
Problem Statement

(approx. 1 paragraph)

In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).
Datasets and Inputs

(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.
Solution Statement

(approx. 1 paragraph)

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).
Benchmark Model

(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.
Evaluation Metrics

(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).
Project Design

(approx. 1 page)

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.

## Applying the Udacity's proposal plan to this project
I- Domain Background
________________________________________
Facilitate people identification had been a crucial challenge for a long time. From ID papers such as ID card to recent biometric methods, the techniques are still ongoing with improvement. 
With new technologies, we still need to introduce safe, easy and reliable methods for people identification. The goal is to match each face with the corresponding person.
We denote recent improvements in the field of computer science, specifically in the field of machine learning, deep learning and computer vision that we think they could allow a lot of enhancement for face recognition.
Some researches are still done on the subject. We could relate for example the recent research work of Brandon Amos, Bartosz Ludwiczuk and Mahadev Satyanarayanan from School of Computer Science of Carnegie Mellon University, in June 2016. They demonstrated how their open source face recognition library OpenFace open the possibilities for face recognition with mobile applications. Their process was built around the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild), a public dataset of more than 13000 Labeled Faces images from about 6000 people. 

My main goal with this project is to build a start to end application for face recognition in video using various technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, and mobile application building in python.
Generally, this requires to have the faces to recognize as input, but they may already be available in a given dataset (associated to a dataset like the LFW presented above) so that the application can compute necessary comparisons methods and give an efficient result. This project should also be applied to both live videos and recorded videos. 
At the end of the project, users should be able to install the application on their smartphone and recognize faces included in their local database using a live video capture with their smartphone or a recorded video. 

II- Problem Statement
________________________________________
Nowadays several methods or technologies are used to perform face recognition. They are a part of the Identification and Authentication process for many infrastructure systems.
